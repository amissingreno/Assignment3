						<h5>Charles Whatts - Owner, Creative director</h5>
						<p>Graduating from The Art Institute in 2003, Charles interned at a local marketing firm but did not like the way the business was run. Instead of continuing down that path, Charles decided to go his own direct and start Arenas Rosadas.
							For the next few years, he built a large client base through unique ideas and a focus on customer service. His passion for both design and people have what made Arenas Rosadas the amazing company it is today.</p>

						<h5>Deborah Ogalthorp - Web developer</h5>
						<p>Back in 2010, Deborah was data analyist who was bored at her job. After meeting the team at Arenas Rosadas, she felt inspired and began studying design. Soon after, she stumbled into web design and started creating sites on the side. 
							Charles saw her potential and soon brought her on board full time. From there she only grew more competent in all things web design and is now the lead developer for the Arenas Rosadas team.</p>

						<h5>Joan Salsalita - Graphic designer</h5>
						<p>From a very early age, Joan was an artist. She drew, she painted, she made collages, and even pottery for a time. When deciding what to persue in college, she went after it all, but eventually majored in graphic design. That background of
							fine art has made her the super creative person she is today. Her passion for design shows and Joan is truly an assest to the team.</p>
